# Conditionals

- In Kotlin, branching can be achieved with `if/else` or `when` conditionals.
- The body of an `if` branch in an `if/else` conditional is only executed when the boolean expression inside the `if` branch condition returns a `true` value.
- Subsequent `else if` branches in an `if/else` conditional get executed only when previous `if` or `else if` branches return `false` values.
- The final `else` branch in an `if/else` conditional only gets executed when all previous `if` or `else if` branches return `false` values.
- It's recommended to use the `when` conditional to replace an `if/else` conditional when there are more than two branches.
- You can write more complex conditions in `when` conditionals with the comma (`,`), `in` ranges, and the `is` keyword.
- `if/else` and `when` conditionals can work as either statements or expressions.
