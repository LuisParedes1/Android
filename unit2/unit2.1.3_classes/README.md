# Classes and Objects

## **Summary**

- There are four main principles of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Classes are defined with the `class` keyword, and contain properties and methods.
- Properties are similar to variables except properties can have custom getters and setters.
- A constructor specifies how to instantiate objects of a class.
- You can omit the `constructor` keyword when you define a primary constructor.
- Inheritance makes it easier to reuse code.
- The IS-A relationship refers to inheritance.
- The HAS-A relationship refers to composition.
- Visibility modifiers play an important role in the achievement of encapsulation.
- Kotlin provides four visibility modifiers: the `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `internal` modifiers.
- A property delegate lets you reuse the getter and setter code in multiple classes.
