/*

    In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, you're given an auctionPrice()
     function that accepts a nullable Bid? type as an argument:

    Complete the auctionPrice() function so that the program prints these lines:

    Item A is sold at 5000.
    Item B is sold at 3000.
 */

fun main() {
    val winningBid = Bid(5000, "Private Collector")
    
    println("Item A is sold at ${auctionPrice(winningBid, 2000)}.")
    println("Item B is sold at ${auctionPrice(null, 3000)}.")
}

class Bid(val amount: Int, val bidder: String)
 
fun auctionPrice(bid: Bid?, minimumPrice: Int): Int {
   return bid?.amount ?: minimumPrice
}
