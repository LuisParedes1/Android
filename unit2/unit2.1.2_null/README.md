# Nullability

- A variable can be set to `null` to indicate that it holds no value.
- Non-nullable variables cannot be assigned `null`.
- Nullable variables can be assigned `null`.
- To access methods or properties of nullable variables, you need to use `?.` safe-call operators or `!!` not-null assertion operators.
- You can use `if/else` statements with `null` checks to access nullable variables in non-nullable contexts.
- You can convert a nullable variable to a non-nullable type with `if/else` expressions.
- You can provide a default value for when a nullable variable is `null` with the `if/else` expression or the `?:` Elvis operator.
